We're launching the common.guide project (in alpha stage)! We've setup a whole new frontend and are working on our backend process. We've published our first iteration of the site and moved the old page to [demo.common.guide](https://demo.common.guide). We've also built up our processes around implmentation and iteration of common.guide. Aiming to setup "package management-esque", "collections" of community written policy.

## The handbook.* standard.
As part of our adoption process, we're establishing a handbook.yourdomain practice. This would be where each project that uses the common guide will publish it's own repository of policies.

## Where are we at?
The project is still early days and there's lots to do! Namely - making a todo list and adding it to the repo. PR's and contributions are encouraged :) In the next few months we'll be adopting the handbook. standard ourselves and focus on iterating policy. This website will probably be updated and have new features added as approached by those groups.

## Who are we/how to contact?
good question, we haven't really figured that out yet. if you're interested in the project maybe raise an issue on github and we'll get in touch:)
